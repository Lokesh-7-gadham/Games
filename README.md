# 🪨 📄 ✂️ Rock, Paper, Scissors – Python CLI

A simple and interactive **Rock–Paper–Scissors** command-line game built with Python.  
This project demonstrates core programming concepts such as conditional logic, user input validation, randomness, and the use of **Enums** for cleaner, more readable code.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Input Validation**  
  Ensures the user enters a valid option (1, 2, or 3) and exits gracefully for invalid input.

- **Randomized Computer Choice**  
  Uses Python’s `random` module to simulate the computer’s move.

- **Clean Data Handling**  
  Utilizes Python’s `Enum` class to avoid magic numbers and improve readability.

- **User-Friendly Output**  
  Clear messages and emojis for better console experience.
