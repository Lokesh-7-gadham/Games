🪨 📄 ✂️ Rock, Paper, Scissors - Python CLI
A simple, interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game built with Python. This project demonstrates basic programming concepts like loops, conditional logic, user input validation, and the use of Enums for cleaner code.

🚀 Features
Input Validation: The game ensures the user enters a valid number (1, 2, or 3) and exits gracefully if the input is invalid.

Randomized AI: Uses Python's random module to provide a challenging computer opponent.

Replayability: A built-in loop allows you to play multiple rounds without restarting the script.

Clean Data Handling: Utilizes Python Enums to manage game choices, making the code more readable and maintainable.

🛠️ Logic Flow
The game follows the classic rules:

Rock beats Scissors.

Paper beats Rock.

Scissors beats Paper.

📋 Prerequisites
To run this game, you only need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. No external libraries are required.

💻 How to Run

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lokesh-7-gadham/rps_game.git
```

Navigate to the directory:
```bash
cd rps_game
```

Run the script:
```bash
python rps_game.py
```

🕹️ How to Play
When prompted, enter 1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, or 3 for Scissors.

The computer will instantly make its choice.

The winner is announced based on the rules.

Type Y to play another round or Q to quit.

🧠 What I Learned
While building this, I practiced:

Using the sys module for controlled program exiting.

Implementing the Enum class to replace "magic numbers" with readable names.

Handling string manipulation to clean up console output.
